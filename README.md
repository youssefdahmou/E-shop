# E-shop
Sure, here's a description for an e-commerce web app called "e-shop" that you could use as a JEE project on GitHub:

Description:

Technologies used:

- Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)
- Apache Tomcat
- MySQL database
- Spring MVC framework
- Bootstrap front-end framework

This e-commerce web app project could serve as a good opportunity to practice building a full-stack Java web application, and implementing features like user authentication, data persistence, and third-party integrations.
